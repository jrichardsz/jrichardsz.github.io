Some days ago I downloaded a movie without subtitles. 

![shift-subtitle]({{ site.url }}/images/example-video.png)

After search I founded an english subtitles in .srt format but 
when I loaded to my video , subtittles begins at 00:00:47 and voices at 00:00:56.

I tried with VLC Player

KMPLAYER

![http://open-media-community.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/KMPlayer.jpg](http://open-media-community.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/KMPlayer.jpg)

without success.

I was determined to develop some node.js script to do this, but I founded this site:

[http://subtitlefix.com/index.php](http://subtitlefix.com/index.php)

And this section

![shift-subtitle]({{ site.url }}/images/Online-subtitle-converter.png)

was exactly what I needed.

My result srt is :


Node.js script coming soon!!
