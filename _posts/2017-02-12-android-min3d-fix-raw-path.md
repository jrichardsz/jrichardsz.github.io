Continuing with testing of 3d android frameworks, I founded this repo:

[https://code.google.com/archive/p/min3d/](https://code.google.com/archive/p/min3d/)

After some hours, I could compile and run in my android device:

This repo is awesome but it's examples has some points "strange" that I fixed :D

## min3d.sampleProject1:raw/camaro_obj

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jrichardsz/56e832ecc5f46e196f71fd55ba09ffdb.js"></script>

**min3d.sampleProject1:raw/camaro_obj** is the path of obj file. When I tried to run this examples I had this problem :

```
ERROR No package identifier when getting value for resource number 
```

This is because string **min3d.sampleProject1** must be the initial package that was setting at the creation project moment.
After some hours, and a little experience in android i could see that this string **min3d.sampleProject1** is related to path for raw files insise **res** folder.

So I created a util class to get this path:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jrichardsz/1c24501766ed02c6049ce2bc5696d5eb.js"></script>

And worked perfectly :D

Android Studio project ready to use:
